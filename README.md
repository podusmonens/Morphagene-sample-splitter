# Morphagene-sample-splitter

Morphagene sample splitter is a Python script which takes a wav file as an input, splits it into chunks of a designated length and then outputs them as individual 32bit/48khz/stereo wav files. It was made to create reels for the Make Noise Morphagene Eurorack module. Once exported, the files can be combined into a reel using the following Reel Assembler web app: https://www.lorenzostanco.com/lab/morphagene/.
